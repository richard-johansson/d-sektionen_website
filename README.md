# TDDD27_2022_dsektionen_website
This project will be a new version of the D-sektionen website. Hopefully some of the changes made in the project will be implemented in the future.

The website will contain neccesary features for members such as a landing-page, a photo and documents page and a page for member services. An admin page will also be developed so that administrators can monitor member activity and post messages, photos and documents that members and guests can view. The landing page will be aimed at high school students and will showcase some highlights from a photo database. It will also contain valueable information for those considering further education at LiU. After a member has signed in, all photos and documents can be viewed.

## Technical Specification
The project will be written in typescript to allow for typing. TypeScript will assist in finding and preventing type-related bugs.

We will use the mern stack to build our web-application:
- MongoDB (database)
- Express (backend framework)
- React (frontend framework)
- Node.js (javaScript runtime environment)

These frameworks wil also be used:
- Bootstrap (css framework)
- Postman (API testing)
